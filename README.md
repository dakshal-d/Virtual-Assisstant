Python Voice Assistant<br>
This project is a simple voice assistant created using Python. The assistant can respond to voice commands and perform tasks such as checking the weather, opening websites, and telling jokes.

<b>Installation</b><br>
To use this voice assistant, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install a few additional packages using pip:

pip install pyttsx3<br>
pip install SpeechRecognition<br>
pip install tkinter<br>
pip install pyjokes<br>
pip install pyaudio<br>
Note: if you have trouble installing pyaudio, you may need to install PortAudio first.<br>
And many other additional packages as shown in the voice.py file<br>

Usage
To start the voice assistant, simply run the voice_assistant.py file:
python voice_assistant.py
Once the assistant is running, you can start giving it voice commands. Here are some examples:

"What's the weather like today?"
"Open YouTube"
"Tell me a joke"
The assistant will respond to your command with either a spoken response or by opening a website in your default web browser.

Customization
If you'd like to customize the assistant's behavior or add new features, you can modify the voice_assistant.py file. Here are a few things you can do:

Change the assistant's voice: the assistant uses the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion, which allows you to change the voice and speed of the assistant's speech.<br>
Add new commands: the assistant currently recognizes a few basic commands, but you can add your own by defining new functions in the voice.py file.<br>
Add new tasks: the assistant currently performs a few basic tasks, but you can add your own by defining new functions in the VoiceAssistant class.
